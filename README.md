# Spatial tools by Colin
Spatial Tools/scripts that I created and use on a semi-regular basis


## Other tools

See also tools for landscape prediction in my `pemgeneratr` package https://github.com/ColinChisholm/pemgeneratr


## avenza waypoints report

Converts point data collected using Avenza Maps into a nice printable report for easy review of the data.


## bcdata data download

Allows user to set an area of interest and then download relevant basemap and forest and land management datasets from [DataBC](https://data.gov.bc.ca).
Numerous datasets for download have been set up in the script and other data sets can be added easily.  Data within the area of interest is downloaded and saved in `geojson` format.  

QGIS Style files for the basemap layers are provided in `./QGIS_Styles`.
